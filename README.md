You can download the apk file and enjoy our app.
This game is only based on prototype JWST 2.0 that we have thought.The JWST 2.0's lenses and defence system will be very powerfull.It could be possible if NASA make a hybrid telescope by fusing DART and JWST.The main motive of this game is to save earth.IF the meteoroides is on the way towards the earth JWST will destroy it by it's missile or sacrifice itself.In this game we have showed that if meteoroides falls towards the earth then JWST 2.0 can help us by launching small missiles and sacrificing itself to make earth safe.If the the meteoroides reaches the end of the screen which is assumed to be earth,the game will be over
Note:- The JWST 2.0 can only move in X-axis.only 3 missiles can be fired from JWST 2.0.When one of the missile touches the upper end of your screen then a new missile comes from JWST 2.0 and this goes in a loop.If their is no missile available the you should smash JWST 2.0 with the meteoroids.Click the down button to play.
